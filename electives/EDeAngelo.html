                    Ms. DeAngelo is very cool and teaches very well. I can
                    retain information very well from the class. The class isn't
                    too hard, it feels just right in difficulty. She doesn't
                    give too much homework, mainly vocabulary flashcards.
                    Studying for thevocab tests is most of the work I do. I
                    study extra, an hour a day, because I have difficulty
                    remembering the content. Sometimes, we are given time in
                    class to finish work or homework.

                    Ms. DeAngelo is an engaging teacher, talking to her feels
                    like talking to a friend or classmate because she is young.
                    When she teaches, she uses PowerPoints and she tests us on
                    the vocabulary. The class is very chill and easy, mostly
                    just a lot of memorization. There isn't any homework, most
                    work given is just making flashcards for tests. Anything not
                    finished in class becomes homework. A few days before a
                    test, I will study for an hour or so every day looking at 10
                    flashcards. Everyone does it differently, but I try to study
                    before every test.
