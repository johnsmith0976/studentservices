        History.

                  Mrs. Levitt is a fun teacher that explains concepts
          slowly and clearly. She seems like she actually cares about her
          students and wants them to succeed. As an AP student, the class is a
          slightly harder one that requires background knowledge to succeed.
          There isn't much homework in the class, it's only assigned once a
          week. I haven't studied much for the class so far, and only have read
          a little of the textbook. Class projects are fun in the class, and I
          look forward to doing more in the future.

                    I do think it is a harder class, because a lot of the questions bring in backgrpund information that you are sometimes expected to know. 
                     There's not much homework, only once or twice a week.
                    Describe the amount of studying you had to do.
    I don't do much studying, and I barely use the textbook.

She liked to use PowerPoints, and was very kind and understanding. I would say that her class is the easiest AP exam, other than AP Spanish. There was almost no homework, and any that was given would take around 20 minutes of class time.

                  In my World History class, I got As in the class and a 3 on the exam. Mrs. Levitt often used slides to teach and we occasionally took notes. We also had a few group projects that were short and fun. She is a very bright and energetic teacher that tries to connect with her students. The class is extremely easy, and so are the tests; most people had an A in the class. There was occasional short homework one or twice a week. I didn't study for the test at all, but you should if you want a 5.
