      <h4>
        What students will learn:
      </h4>

      <p>
        Confidence in Programming languages like HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript,
        and Java
      </p>

      <h4>
        In-class Workload:
      </h4>

      <p>
        All work is done in class, learning, collaborating, and presenting
      </p>

      <h4>
        Homework:
      </h4>

      <p>
        No homework unless you are absent or missed class
      </p>

      <h4>
        Materials Required:
      </h4>

      <p>
        Notebook/journal, flash drive, headphones
      </p>

      <h4>
        Tests & Quizzes:
      </h4>

      <p>
        Quizzes at the end of each unit, pop quizzes occasionally, midterms in
        December and finals in June
      </p>

      <h4>
        Self-Studying:
      </h4>

      <p>
        Independent learning is highly encouraged, programming is more reliant
        on creativity and collaboration
      </p>

      <h4>
        If your class is AP, please describe the AP exam.
      </h4>

      <p>
        AP CS Principles is taken by Juniors, an easier AP. AP CS A is a
        rigorous AP, involves expertise in Java and debugging code
      </p>

      <h4>
        If your class is AP, please describe how the Honors and AP experience
        differs from a student's perspective.
      </h4>

      <p>
        There is no Honors designation for the Java technical program. Students
        are not required to take the AP tests at the end of the year but it is
        highly encouraged.

                    Mrs. Sundar explains lessons well, and work in the class is
                    very hands off. She does provide assistance and helps us
                    very often. The class wasn't very difficult because I was
                    interested in coding and I had some prior knowledge. The
                    class helped me to learn how to make a website. Sundar would
                    explain concepts and we would work around those concepts.
                    <br /><br />The class isn't hard if you pay attention, and
                    you are given a lot of independence to do what you want.
                    There isn't any homework at all, and I only ever had to
                    occasionally reference my notes. <br /><br />
                    The AP exam has a lot of problem solving, evaluation, and
                    applying concepts. When I studied for the test, it was just
                    a lot of working on practice tests. Overall, it's a very fun
                    class and the teacher is cool.

                    Mrs. Sundar is a very helpful and nice teacher. The class isn't too hard; if you can understand what's happening, then you can get by. I had no prior knowledge of coding. There isn't any homework in class and studying ins't necessary. For the AP exam, Sundar provided resources for us to study, like Gmetrix. Overall, the class is fun and has many interesting concepts.

                  Mrs. Sundar is a great, interactive teacher that gets really one-on-one focused. I believe the class difficulty is subjective; if you try, then the class won't betoo hard. There isn't any homework or studying because evrrything getsa ingrained into your head. Material learned in class get used constantly. There are a lot of practice exams using Gmetrix that can range from easy to semi-difficult. Overall, make sure you take advantage of the class resources and the many opportunities offerfed, such as SkillsUSA and tech internships.

                    Senior year in the Java Development program is much more difficult since you move on to learning Java from JavaScript. You are expected to have some prior knowledge, and you work independently much more. The difficult part is the higher workload, and learning Java is painful because it is so easy to make mistakes. Overall, it feels like a continuation of last year.

                      This year is less hands on and more individual focused. She expects you to know how things work from last year, and you still work in groups a lot. It feels like there's more studying, reviewing, and taking practice tests on CollegeBoard. To incoming juniors, I would say that you should take the ideas from junior year and don't get too over your head. Take things one step at a time, things have changed from last year.
