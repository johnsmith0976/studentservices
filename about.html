        Our purpose:
      </h1>
      <p>
        McFatter Student Services is designed to give students a heads up about
        their classes and teachers. We use the opinions of past and present
        students to describe both the class and teaching styles of teachers at
        the school. We also give general information about the school to provide
        viewers with a better understanding of the various aspects of our
        campus.
      </p>

      <h1>
        Why we created this website:
      </h1>
      <p>
        We created this website because we wanted an "A" for this project.

        About our creators:
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our creaters, Nathan, Patrick, and Andy decided to create a website to
        help the students of Mcfatter choose their programs and to learn more
        about the teachers and clubs of the school. Nathan came up with the idea
        after we brainstormed for a new website that could benefit the students
        of McFatter. Patrick was the lead programer as he had already learned
        HTML and was on CSS by the time we started making the website. Andy
        designed many of the page layouts of the website and chose the color
        scheme.
